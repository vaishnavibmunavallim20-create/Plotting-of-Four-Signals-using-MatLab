# Plotting-of-Four-Signals-using-MatLab
Using MatLab creating 4 signals :sine, square, triangular and composite.
I have Plotted 4 types of Signals includes sine signal, square signal, Triangular signal and Composite signal by using matlab GUI
Sine wave: Sine function from MATLAB
Square wave:square function
Triangular wave:triangular function
Composite wave:Additional function sine, square, triangular
Sine wave:  Sine function from MATLAB,
Square wave:  square function,
Triangular wave:  triangular function,
Composite wave:  Additional function sine, square,Â triangular
